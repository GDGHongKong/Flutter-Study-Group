## Challenge Requirements

Write a Flutter application that has an image. Clicking the image will open a lightbox.

i. Implement hero animations for opening and closing the lightbox.

ii. Enable resizing of the image using two-finger gestures.

iii. Make the lightbox dismissible by swiping upward or downward.

iv. Adjust the hero animation based on the dismiss direction, such as flying from the top to the center or from the bottom to the center.

v. Fade the opacity of the lightbox background as the dismiss progress occurs.

## Disclaimer

This is just an example of how to build the required UI in Flutter. It may not be the only solution, nor the best solution.

This solution works on Flutter version 3.13.6. It may or may not work on future versions of Flutter.
